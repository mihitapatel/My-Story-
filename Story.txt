Once upon a time in a forest. There lived a monkey who recided on a berry trre which was on the bank of the river.
In the same forest there lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day the crocidile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kinded hearted monkey offered 
some fruits. The crocidile came back the next day for more fruits as he loved them. As time passed by, the crocidile 
and monkey became good friends.
